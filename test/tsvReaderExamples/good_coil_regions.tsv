# An example coil regions file. 
# The format is based off of what Stefan Gerhardt gave me (JAS) for the NSTX coil geometry data.
# I think this is the sort of format that EFIT uses.
#
# [unused] region = region index of the form J.s where J is a unique integer and s is 
# either 0 or 1.  Negative J indicates that the region is not active, while 
# positive J forces the region to be included in the circuit equations.  
# s = 0 corresponds to treating the region as passive, while s = 1 implies the 
# region will be part of a coil group.
#
# R = the major radial location of the region (meters)
#
# Z = the vertical location of the region (meters)
# 
# W = full width of the region (meters)
# 
# H = full height of the region (meters)
#
# [unused] AC1 = angular inclination of the upper and lower segments of the region
# parallelogram relative to horizontal (degrees) (EFIT definition)
# 
# [unused] AC2 = angular inclination of the side segments of the region 
# parallelogram relative to horizontal (degrees) (EFIT definition)
#
# [unused] Q = quadrant index of the region:
# Q = 0 ==> region is centered at R,Z
# Q = 1 ==> region lower left  vertex is located at R,Z
# Q = 2 ==> region lower right vertex is located at R,Z
# Q = 3 ==> region upper right vertex is located at R,Z
# Q = 4 ==> region upper left  vertex is located at R,Z
# 
# NR = number of radial   rectangular subdivisions in the region
#
# NZ = number of vertical rectangular subdivisions in the region
#
# [unused] Iresistance = resistivity index of the region (Ohm-m, see below)
#
# [unused] caf = conducting area fraction within the region for use in properly accounting
# for the void fraction of the subregions.  The area of each subregion is 
# multiplied by caf when computing the circuit resistance of the subregion.
#
# [unused] isf = inductance scaling factor, which increases the self inductance of 
# elements within the region.  This is almost always set to 1, but 
# non-axisymmetric components will sometimes need this changed to achieve the 
# proper axisymmetric-equivalent behavior.  Mutual inductances between 
# included elements and elements of non-rescaled regions are increased using	
# M_scale() in coil_fields.pro, and the scaling factor for such coupling
# is SQRT(isf).  
#
# current = The current in each of the subregions for this region. (It is assumed that all the subregions are in series).
