Jacob's presentation script:

The most difficult part about running COUGAR is finding the required input data:

locations and currents through the external coils
appropriate guesses for the pressure on the magnetic axis 
and for the current distribution,
determining the best size of the computational domain...

we have not actually succeeded yet...

We used boost_program_options to manage the configuration options such as those above.
they can be specified in a file or on the command line. Unspecified options have defaults as well.

If you'd like to know what options are available and what the defaults are, consult

./gs_solver --help

.

The program looks for a config file called grad-shafranov.cfg,
so to run the program one needs only to type

[does command]
./gs_solver

This outputs cougar.out.tsv, a text file.
In this file are the final values of psi on the solution grid.
Also are grids for the helper functions p and g, for diagnostic purposes.

We can view these by using a plot command:

[does command]
python python/viz.py cougar.out.tsv tsv
